## Vue in the front Express in the back

Express is used to serve up our api routes, Vue(x) is used to handle the SPA.

Sqlite is used as the database for the API.

Todo items are stored in localStorage as well as the database. And they are synced when necessary.

## What to do?

Execute the following commands from the root of the project.

```$> npm install```
